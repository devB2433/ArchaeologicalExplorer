## 💡 Game Tips

### 🎯 Beginner's Guide

1. **Start with Basics**: Use all 6 starting tools (8 weight) for Beginner routes
2. **Item Limit Matters**: At Level 1, you can only carry 3 items max! Choose wisely
3. **Weight Strategy**: Don't just pick any 3 items — calculate total weight
   - Example: Camera(1) + Shovel(2) + Bucket(2) = 5 weight (still Beginner)
   - Avoid: 3 random heavy tools might exceed Beginner range
4. **Level Up First**: Reach Level 2-3 before attempting Advanced routes
5. **Read About Ruins**: Each ruin has real historical information and citations!

### 🌟 Advanced Strategies

1. **Weight Optimization**:
   - For Beginner (1-20): Mix light tools, total ≤20
   - For Advanced (15-50): Add medium tools like Trowel, Drone
   - For Master (40+): Use legendary tools like LiDAR + GPR

2. **Item Slot Management**:
   - Level 1-2: Only 3 slots — prioritize weight-efficient tools
   - Level 3-4: 4-5 slots — can now add Drone or Aerial Imagery
   - Level 5+: 6-8 slots — finally use full legendary loadout

3. **Discovery Probability**:
   - Common ruins (85-90%): Easy to discover on Beginner routes
   - Rare ruins (70-80%): Need Advanced routes, may take multiple tries
   - Hidden ruins (20-25%): Master routes only, very challenging!

4. **Efficient Leveling**:
   - Each discovery = 25-50 EXP
   - First-time discoveries = bonus EXP
   - Focus on high-probability ruins first to level up faster
