LiDAR
Lidar uses light from a pulsed laser to measure things on the Earth. After that, the data is collected it can be turned into a very realistic 3-D map.

Ground-penetrating radar (GPR)
In archeology, ground-penetrating radar is used to create images of what lies beneath the ground, allowing archaeologists to map and record things like foundations, burial sites, and artifacts without digging.

Just cameras
Drones
In archeology, drones can be used to find areas, go into places humans can’t fit in, call for help and scan underground areas.

Trowel
Archaeologists use a trowel as their primary tool for careful excavation because its flat blade allows them to slowly and precisely scrape away soil, revealing fragile artifacts without damaging them.

Shovel
In archaeology, shovels are used for the primary tasks of shovel testing to survey for sites, excavating larger areas of soil, and backfilling to return soil to the site after excavation.

Hand pick (Mattock)
The pick mattock is a very handy tool that combines the pointed head of a pick, used for digging up hard soil and rock, and an adze, which can be used for cutting through roots.

Wheelbarrow
Archaeologists use wheelbarrows primarily to move large quantities of excavated soil, rocks, and debris, known as "spoil," away from the excavation site. They are an essential tool for maintaining a clean and orderly site, allowing for efficient work and the careful sifting of material for artifacts.
